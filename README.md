## **Here's my story:**
In the early 2000s, I embarked on a self-taught journey into website development, utilizing online resources and nothing more than Notepad. My enthusiasm for anime, manga, and Japanese culture found expression as I crafted websites centered around these interests. The expat community in Japan, exemplified by platforms like Sushicam.com and Photokyo.com, became a wellspring of inspiration, propelling me to delve into photography and rudimentary web development. Meeting some of my inspirations, such as Jeremy Arey and Chris Jue, was a gratifying highlight.

As time progressed, I delved into creating my own blog, archived on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20041121130526/http://www.raymidwest.com/) since 2004. Self-learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript marked my foray into a web development landscape vastly different from today's. In 2004, Squarespace emerged, followed by Wix just two years later. Concurrently, I initiated my Java course in high school, oblivious to the evolving web technology scene.

Nearly two decades later, I find myself revisiting and refining my skills, reflecting on a journey that started with humble beginnings. Despite the proliferation of user-friendly platforms, I am surprised to discover that there still exists a niche for developers. Currently, I am starting my coding voyage from ~~scratch~~ experience, aiming for a longevity comparable to achieving fluency in a language like Spanish or French. This narrative encapsulates my story, and I invite you to join me on this evolving journey. Thank you for being a part of the ride!  Find more about this bootcamp below:
